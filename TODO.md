# Server Guy TODOs

## Home-server controller mode

- [ ] Install Server Guy on an always-on home server and connect to it from the Mac over the same Wi-Fi/LAN.

Initial scope:

- The home server runs the authoritative Server Guy controller, monitoring, Pi runtime, and SQLite database.
- The Mac accesses its UI and API over the local network; no Tailscale dependency is required initially.
- Give the home server a stable LAN address or local hostname.
- Require authentication even on the home network.
- Do not share or synchronize the SQLite file with the Mac.
- Consider Tailscale later only for access from outside the home network.
